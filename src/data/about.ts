  "I specialize in building scalable backend systems using Node.js, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL, with over five years of experience in production environments. My focus is on reliability, long-term maintainability, and architectural clarity.",
  "I approach software as a system of constraints. I design with failure scenarios, edge cases, and future evolution in mind while prioritizing stability over quick fixes. This mindset has consistently reduced production defects and improved long-term maintainability.",
  "I value clean abstractions, explicit trade-offs, and thoughtful testing. I aim to deliver systems that remain understandable and adaptable long after their initial release.",
